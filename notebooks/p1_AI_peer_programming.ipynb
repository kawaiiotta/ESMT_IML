    "# A Vanilla ML Workflow Peer-Programmed with AI\n",
    "No doubt you have heard about Generative AI (GenAI). In this session, we study how GenAI, specifically, ChatGPT can help us develop a Python script for analysis data. We consider a data set related to credit risk modeling and use ChatGPT to create codes for taking a first look at the data or, more formally, to engage in explanatory data analysis (EDA). The notebook provides four prompts, which have been tested and should work reasonably well. That said, there is no guarantee that these prompts will lead ChatGPT to output code that is ready to use. As said, one learning goal of this session is to *study how GenAI can help us*. We should not expect it to do all the work ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest you begin with the prompts below. Afterwards, you are most welcome to make changes, adjust the prompts, and examine how changes in your prompts change the generated codes; and, by extension, the effectiveness of the GenAI support. Let's move on with the first prompt."

    "You are a data scientist working for a major retail bank. You received a data set of past transactions. Specifically, the data set is available as an MS Excel file hmeq.xlsx. Each row represents one loan application, which is characterized by several attributes (i.e., the columns).\n",
    "The table includes a binary target variable named \"BAD\", which indicates whether the credit was repaid (BAD==0) or not (BAD==1). Furthermore, the data set includes the following attributes:\n",
    "- LOAN: amount of the loan request\n",
    "- MORTDUE: amount due on an existing mortgage\n",
    "- VALUE: value of current property\n",
    "- REASON: DebtCon=debt consolidation; HomeImp=home improvement\n",

    "- NINQ: number of recent credit inquiries\n",
    "- CLNO: number of credit lines\n",
    "- DEBTINC: debt-to-income ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write Python code to read the data from the Excel file and perform explanatory data analysis (EDA). The EDA step should involve the analysis of descriptive statistics of the attributes and make use of suitable visualizations to study their distribution. Bear in mind that the bank is very interested in the association between the attributes and the target. Therefore, your EDA should also comprise analysis/visualizations that shed light on the association of attributes and the target. Please make sure your analysis distinguishes properly between numerical attributes and categorical data.\n",
